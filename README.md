Earny: Great! Now, let's gather some information to provide you with personalized investment advice:

What is your age?
Are you saving for a short-term goal, like buying a car, or a long-term goal like retirement?
On a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is very conservative (low risk) and 10 is very aggressive (high risk), how would you rate your risk tolerance?
(User answers all three questions)

Earny: Thank you for providing the information. Based on your age, goal of saving for retirement, and moderate risk tolerance, I recommend considering a diversified portfolio of equity mutual funds or ETFs. These investments have the potential for higher returns over the long term, which aligns well with your age and risk profile.

In these examples, Earny first asks the user to choose their preferred language, ensuring effective communication. It then gathers information through a series of questions and provides a final response with investment advice based on the accumulated information.
